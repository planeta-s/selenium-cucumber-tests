Project Name: selenium-cucumber-tests

Description:
This project is a collection of automated tests for an e-commerce website (https://mystore-testlab.coderslab.pl) using Selenium WebDriver and Cucumber (BDD framework). The tests cover essential user interactions such as account management, address creation, product purchase, and order verification.

Implemented Test Scenarios:
✅ Workshop Task 1 - User Account & Address Management
Manually create a user.
Log in with the created user.
Navigate to the "Addresses" section and add a new address using test data from a Gherkin table.
Verify that the address details are correctly saved.
(Optional) Delete the address and confirm its removal.
✅ Workshop Task 2 - Product Purchase & Order Validation
Log in as the same user.
Add a Hummingbird Printed Sweater to the cart. (Optional: Verify 20% discount)
Select size M (with parameterized support for sizes S, M, L, XL).
Choose 5 items (with parameterized quantity selection).
Proceed to checkout and confirm the address.
Select "Pick up in store" as the delivery method.
Choose "Pay by Check" as the payment method.
Complete the order and capture a screenshot of the confirmation.
This project demonstrates automated test scenarios for e-commerce workflows using Selenium WebDriver + Cucumber and ensures that key functionalities work correctly.
